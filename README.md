# PROXYDROID AUTO

**Disclaimer:**
This is a personal pet project that I decided to share.
The app works, but may contain hacks and rough edges.
I am a complete novice in Android development and used AI assistance.

## Description

- Modified version of ProxyDroid Plus with autostart and auto-enable features.
- Original version: [ProxyDroid Plus](https://github.com/rinnn31/proxydroid-modded)
- Significantly cleaned up and simplified.
- Only English and Russian translations are included; other languages from the original version have been removed.

## Usage
> Note: Root access is required

1. Install ProxyDroid Auto apk.
2. Start the app for the first time to create the default configuration and activate the broadcast receiver.
3. Grant root access when prompted.
4. Enable autostart.
5. The app will now automatically start on device boot and enable the proxy as configured.

### TODO
- Get rid of precompiled binaries
